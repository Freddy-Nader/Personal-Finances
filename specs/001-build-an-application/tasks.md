# Tasks: Personal Finance Management Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-an-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-contracts.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   -> Tech stack: Python 3.11+ backend, vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
   -> Structure: Web application (backend/ + frontend/)
   -> Storage: SQLite database
2. Load design documents:
   -> data-model.md: 6 entities (Card, Section, Transaction, InvestmentPosition, Movement, CardFeesInterests)
   -> contracts/api-contracts.yaml: 14 API endpoints across 4 groups
   -> quickstart.md: 5 user stories with test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   -> Setup: project structure, dependencies, environment
   -> Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD)
   -> Core: models, services, API endpoints
   -> Integration: database, server, frontend
   -> Polish: unit tests, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   -> Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   -> Tests before implementation (TDD principle)
   -> Dependencies: Models -> Services -> Endpoints -> Frontend
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before everything
- Contract tests (T005-T022) before models (T028-T033)
- Integration tests (T023-T027) before services (T034-T038)
- Models (T028-T033) before services (T034-T038)
- Services (T034-T038) before API endpoints (T039-T056)
- API endpoints (T039-T056) before frontend (T057-T074)
- Core implementation before performance tests (T075-T081)
- All implementation before final validation (T082-T084)

## Parallel Execution Examples
```bash
# Launch contract tests together (T005-T022):
# All 18 contract tests can run simultaneously as they're in different files

# Launch integration tests together (T023-T027):
# All 5 integration tests can run simultaneously

# Launch model creation together (T028-T033):
# All 6 models can be created simultaneously

# Launch service creation together (T034-T038):
# All 5 services can be created simultaneously

# Launch frontend pages together (T057-T064):
# All frontend files can be created simultaneously
```

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before considering tasks complete*

- [x] All 14 API endpoints have corresponding contract tests
- [x] All 6 entities have model creation tasks
- [x] All 5 user stories have integration tests
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD)
- [x] Parallel tasks ([P]) are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Dependencies properly ordered: Setup -> Tests -> Models -> Services -> Endpoints -> Frontend -> Polish

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify ALL tests fail before implementing (TDD principle)
- Default currency MXN per user requirement
- Chart.js justified as minimal framework exception
- Constitutional requirements: <3s loads, <100ms interactions, <500KB bundles
- Internal transfers create paired transactions (debit/credit)
- Investment prices fetched on-demand, not stored
- Commit after each completed task
