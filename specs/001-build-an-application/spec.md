# Feature Specification: Personal Finance Management Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that helps manage personal finances and personal contability. Users can add credit and debit cards, register movements in cards or in cash, and register positions in stocks and in crypto. The app should have four main tabs (pages):
1. Dashboard: A place where the user can see general statistics about their finances. The user should be able to see graphs, tables, and other metrics showing their balances and profits/losses throughout different periods.
2. Transactions: A place where the user can add new transactions and movements from their cards, their cash,
3. Manage: A place where the user can add new cards and modify information about them: their name, whether they are debit or credit, their default currency (MXN, USD, dares era socion into nos the stock market or cryptocurrencies. etc.), their initial balance or credit limit, add sections for the card ("emergency", "birthday", etc.), and add interests (+) or fees (-) of the cards.
4. Movements: A place where the user can add new movements in the stock or crypto market."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   -> If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   -> Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   -> Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   -> If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   -> Each requirement must be testable
   -> Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   -> If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   -> If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to track and manage their complete financial picture including bank accounts, credit/debit cards, cash transactions, stock investments, and cryptocurrency holdings. They need to visualize their financial health through a dashboard with statistics and graphs, easily add new transactions across all their financial instruments, manage their payment cards and investment accounts, and track their investment movements in stocks and crypto.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has multiple financial accounts, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see consolidated statistics, graphs, and metrics showing balances and profits/losses across different time periods
2. **Given** a user wants to record a purchase, **When** they access the transactions tab, **Then** they can add new transactions for their cards or cash with all necessary details
3. **Given** a user has credit and debit cards, **When** they access the manage tab, **Then** they can add new cards, modify card information (name, type, currency, balance/limit), create card sections, and set up interests or fees
4. **Given** a user invests in stocks or crypto, **When** they access the movements tab, **Then** they can record new investment movements and track their portfolio positions
5. **Given** a user has recorded transactions over time, **When** they view dashboard analytics, **Then** they can see profit/loss trends filtered by different time periods

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add a transaction for a card that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle negative balances on debit cards?
- What happens when stock or crypto prices need to be updated for portfolio calculations?
- How are currency conversions handled when users have cards in different currencies?
