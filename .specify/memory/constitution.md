## Core Principles

### I. Minimal Framework Dependency
MUST avoid frameworks unless absolutely necessary for application functionality. Prefer vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. When frameworks are required, they MUST be justified with clear technical necessity documentation. Framework selection MUST prioritize bundle size, performance impact, and long-term maintainability over developer convenience.

*Rationale: Reduces complexity, improves performance, eliminates framework lock-in, and ensures long-term maintainability without external dependencies becoming obsolete.*

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
MUST implement comprehensive testing before any code deployment. Unit tests MUST cover all business logic functions. Integration tests MUST verify data flow between components. End-to-end tests MUST validate complete user workflows. Test coverage MUST exceed 80% for all production code. Tests MUST pass before any commit or deployment.

*Rationale: Financial applications require absolute reliability. Bugs in financial calculations or data handling can cause significant user harm and loss of trust.*

### III. User Experience Consistency
UI design MUST follow Notion-inspired styling patterns as defined in docs/notion-reference.md. Typography, spacing, color schemes, and component behaviors MUST maintain visual consistency across all application pages. User interactions MUST provide immediate feedback. Loading states MUST be implemented for operations exceeding 100ms. Error messages MUST be clear and actionable.

*Rationale: Consistent UX builds user trust and reduces cognitive load, especially important for financial applications where users need confidence in the interface.*

### IV. Performance Requirements
Page load times MUST NOT exceed 3 seconds on standard broadband connections. Interactive elements MUST respond within 100ms. Bundle sizes MUST NOT exceed 500KB for initial page load. Images MUST be optimized and served in modern formats (WebP, AVIF). Database queries MUST complete within 1 second for standard operations.

*Rationale: Financial applications are used frequently and users expect responsive, fast interactions when managing their money.*

### V. Code Quality Standards
Code MUST follow consistent formatting and naming conventions. Functions MUST be pure and predictable where possible. Side effects MUST be isolated and clearly documented. Code MUST be self-documenting with meaningful variable and function names. Complex business logic MUST include inline comments explaining the financial reasoning.

*Rationale: Financial calculations require clarity and auditability. Clean, readable code reduces bugs and makes financial logic verifiable.*

## Performance Standards

All financial calculations MUST complete synchronously without blocking the UI. Data persistence operations MUST provide optimistic UI updates with rollback capability. Chart and graph rendering MUST handle datasets up to 10,000 transactions without performance degradation. Memory usage MUST NOT exceed 100MB for typical user datasets.

## Development Standards

Git commits MUST include clear, descriptive messages following conventional commit format. Pull requests MUST include test coverage reports and performance impact analysis. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to all constitutional principles. Security review MUST be conducted for any code handling financial data or user authentication.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and decisions. Changes to core principles require unanimous approval from all active contributors. All code contributions MUST be validated against these principles during review. Performance benchmarks MUST be maintained and monitored continuously.

Violations of NON-NEGOTIABLE principles result in automatic build failure and deployment blocking. Regular audits MUST be conducted monthly to ensure ongoing compliance with all principles.
